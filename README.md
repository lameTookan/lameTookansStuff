# lameToucans_stuff

 Random stuff I have built up over my time learning python

 Not really meant to public use, just uploading this so I can access it from anywhere

## Mini-Modules

ascii_art just some random ascii art I found on line
notes_stuff I like to take my notes within python files, these are just for formatting and printing headers and such
fun -> just some random stuff I have made for fun, like for decorating text
dividers -> collection of dividers found online and some functions to make some
code_list_master -> for use in notes. A list of variables for each section, empty docstrings. Nothing too interesting
frames -> for framing text with unicode characters
colors -> for printing colored text
